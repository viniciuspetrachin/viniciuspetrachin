<h2 align="left">Vin√≠cius Petrachin</h2>

<p>Welcome to my profile here on github. I will try whenever possible to show my progress through projects, contributions in my area.
I'm a young developer looking to get better every day. I really like the mobile area where I started with Java for Android and then migrated to React Native to pursue cross-platform development</p>

<p>My hobby is programming, coming up with ideas, trying to create solo projects and putting them into practice, I'm really looking for entrepreneurship. I've had projects that went wrong, others went right but were economically unfeasible for my reality. But I will try until I succeed.</p>

<h2>My Area of Knowledge and Affinities</h2>

 <li>Javascript</li>

 <li>English: listening are basic, reading are intermediate.</li>
 <li>Java</li>
 <li>MongoDB</li>
</ul>
