<h2 align="left">Hello, how are you?!</h2>

<p>My name is vinicius I'm 23 years old, I've always loved technology and programming since I was young, but I didn't have a source of work, because my father said there was no future, it was only now in the last 4 years that I understood that I was this is what I should live with. Since then, I've been studying more to get more and more into the job market I love the most.</p>
<p>In my programming journey I've already learned C, Java, PHP and now I'm focused on Javascript/Typescript, which is the language I have the most knowledge of. I really like mobile development so I chose react ecosystem to delve deeper.</p>
